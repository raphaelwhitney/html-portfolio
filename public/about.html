  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Web Developer and Media Technology Specialist with a unique cross-disciplinary background in audio QC,<br /> 
  subtitle engineering, and digital film distribution. My journey began in the creative industry, where I mastered Filmhub-standard <br />
  audio quality control, subtitle formatting, and Prime Video delivery requirements. This experience trained me to pay close <br />
  attention to detail, technical precision, and the ability to troubleshoot complex digital-media issues—skills that now strengthen <br />
  my approach to software development.</p>

<p>Today, I build modern, responsive websites using WordPress, Wix, and the full-stack tools I am currently mastering: HTML, CSS, <br />
  JavaScript, React, Node.js, APIs, databases, and deployment workflows. I specialize in creating clean UI/UX, functional dashboards, <br />
  restaurant menu APIs, small business websites, and performance-optimized pages. I love turning client ideas into digital products <br />
  that are fast, reliable, and easy to manage. I combine my media-tech background with software engineering practices to deliver <br />
  high-quality, production-ready solutions.</p>

<p>I am also working toward a Master’s degree in Software Engineering, with a long-term goal of building scalable applications and <br />
  becoming an expert in backend development and cloud systems. My clients value my professionalism, communication, and my <br />
  ability to understand both creative and technical requirements. Whether it’s developing a brand-new website, fixing performance <br />
  issues, creating subtitles, or delivering audio QC for streaming platforms, I bring the same consistency: quality, clarity, and results</p>
